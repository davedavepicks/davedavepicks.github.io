DaveDavePicks is probably most known for the original Sgian, an ergonomic flat pick, and for the Òrd thumb pick - signature pick of [Ben Smith](https://bensmithguitar.com/). Both of these have left- and right-hand variants. [Get in touch](contact.md) if you're left handed for the lefty discount! 

For the thumb picks, you'll also need to know your size. See the size chart below. The key here is not to overestimate - if you can, use calipers, and slightly squeeze in line with the base of your thumb nail, measuring width and height. The guy is important as Òrd and Sleagh thumb picks don't flex like common injection moulded thumb picks, which are usually made small.
