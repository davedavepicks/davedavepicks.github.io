## General Information
Bound wooden rounded triangle

The original *bound* plectrum, named in an Instagram competition - wooden version. Handmade from two different woods and requiring precision positive and negative curves to allow the parts to come together. This takes time... See The Hebridean II for the 3d-printed version, that's equally awesome and much less time consuming to make!
