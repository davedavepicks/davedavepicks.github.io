## General Information
Bound rounded triangle

An evolution of the Hebridean - original *bound* plectrum, based on the DaveDavePicks Triquetra and named after the Scottish Hebridean Isles in an Instagram competition - to allow for 3d printing. Constructed from two parts of differently coloured 3d-printing resin. This still takes time, but not as much as the handmade ones! The 3d-printed version features a DDP logo and a silhouette of the Outer Hebrides - part of the Scottish Western Isles.

## Materials
resin

25.5 mm x 27.2 mm x 4.0 mm.<br/><br/>Always check individual listings on the [DaveDavePicks Heavy Repping! shop](https://heavyrepping.com/davedavepicks/shop/) for exact measurements.
