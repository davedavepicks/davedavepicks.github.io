## General Information
Jimmy Brewer Signature Pick - The *Dreag*

When Jimmy Brewer of acoustic duo *Smith and Brewer* received his prototype, he said it looked like it came from outer space - the *Dreag* (meaning *meteor*) was born! Small, but thick, sharp and forceful, this one really packs a punch! 3d printed and cast versions feature DDP and *Dreag* logos. Handmade versions can have ergonomic carves like the *Sgian* series picks.

## Materials
acrylic, resin, epoxy

## Dimensions
20.2 mm x 25.5 mm x 6.0 mm
