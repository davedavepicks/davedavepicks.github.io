## General Information
Bound rounded triangle

The original *bound* plectrum - based on the DaveDavePicks Triquetra and named after the Scottish Hebridean Isles in an Instagram competition - acrylic version. Handmade from two different colours of acrylic and requiring precision positive and negative curves to allow the parts to come together. This takes time... See The Hebridean II for the 3d-printed version, that's equally awesome and much less time consuming to make!

## Materials
acrylic

## Dimensions
26 mm x 27 mm x 4 mm.<br/><br/>Always check individual listings on the [DaveDavePicks Heavy Repping! shop](https://heavyrepping.com/davedavepicks/shop/) for exact measurements.
