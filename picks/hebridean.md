Always see the DaveDavePicks shop on [Heavy Repping!](https://www.heavyrepping.com/store/shop/davedavepicks/) for current listings and their exact descriptions.

## General Information
Bound rounded triangle

The original *bound* plectrum, named in an Instagram competition - acrylic version. Handmade from two different colours of acrylic and requiring precision positive and negative curves to allow the parts to come together. This takes time... See The Hebridean II for the 3d-printed version, that's equally awesome and much less time consuming to make!

## Materials
acrylic

## Dimensions
26 mm x 27 mm x 4 mm
